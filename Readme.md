# Rotating Navigation

Unlike your everyday nav bar, this one is quite "quirky". There are two icons at the top of the page which reveals and hides the nav when the user clicks on it. To reveal the nav, the main page rotates some degrees in the anti-clockwise direction.

This is a project form a course by Brad Traversy.

## Lessons Learned

#### CSS
I learn about CSS transitions and transformations and how they can be used to tilt entire pages using the translate and rotate property. I also learnt about positioning of elements on a page. 

#### JavaScript
I learnt about event listeners, which added a class to the icons when the user clicks an icon.
